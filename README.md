# Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy classification using machine learning
The project aims to leverage a comprehensive database sourced from major manufacturing plants across three different countries, including Brazil, to analyse and mitigate workplace accidents. With a focus on promoting industrial safety and health, the database provides insights into the occurrence, severity, and potential risks associated with accidents within these plants. By sharing this valuable dataset with the community, the project seeks to foster collaborative efforts in understanding accident patterns, identifying root causes, and implementing proactive measures to prevent future incidents.

Scenario 1: Galaxy Morphology Classification

Astronomers are interested in studying the morphology of galaxies to understand their formation and evolution processes. By utilizing machine learning techniques, researchers can train a classification model to categorize galaxies into different morphological types such as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. This automated classification process enables astronomers to analyze large datasets of galaxy images efficiently and identify trends or patterns related to galaxy morphology.

Scenario 2: Galaxy Redshift Estimation

Redshift, which indicates the extent to which light from a galaxy has been shifted towards longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe, is a crucial parameter for studying cosmic distances and cosmological phenomena. Machine learning models can be trained to estimate galaxy redshifts based on features extracted from their spectra or photometric properties measured by SDSS. Accurate redshift estimation enables astronomers to map the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the universe and investigate large-scale structures such as galaxy clusters and filaments.

Scenario 3: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) Identification

Galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit intense emission from a compact region at their centers, powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes. Identifying AGN candidates from SDSS data is essential for studying their properties and understanding their impact on galaxy evolution. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize characteristic signatures of AGN in galaxy spectra or multi-wavelength photometric data, facilitating the automated identification of AGN hosts within large galaxy surveys like SDSS. This enables astronomers to conduct statistical analyses of AGN properties and investigate their role in galaxy formation and evolution processes.
